<p style="margin-left:25px;margin-top:30px;">Our blood is the oxygen and nutrient supplying means without which the transport is not possible. It also transmits the impurities to the respective filtering organs such as liver and kidneys so as to make the body free of toxins all the time. It has self-healing properties but with years of job being done, it itself gets toxic and needs immediate cleanse.
</p>

<p style="margin-left:25px;">Blood detoxification in this context refers to cleaning the blood so that it gets rejuvenated and performs its task optimally. It can be done once in a year by following healthy lifestyle.
</p>
<p style="margin-left:25px;">
Your blood feeds every cell, tissue, gland, organ, and organ system in your body. Without strong, oxygen-rich blood these systems can become compromised. Here are 17 ways to build stronger, richer, healthier blood:
</p>

<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">Get moving: </span> The best way to build oxygen-rich blood is to exercise. Not only does exercise help your heart pump blood, it brings fresh oxygen.</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">Breathe deeply:</span> Breathing deeply brings more oxygen to your lungs which then moves directly across into your blood.</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Eat more legumes : </span> Rich in fiber and nutrients, beans and legumes help eliminate harmful cholesterol (LDL) and lower triglycerides.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Get adequate iron: </span>  Iron forms the center of the hemoglobin molecule making it essential for strong blood.  Many pre-menopausal women are deficient in iron and may need supplementation. Because excess iron can be dangerous, get your levels tested prior to supplementation. Some foods that are good sources of iron include:  lentils, kidney beans, prunes, green vegetables, beef and bison. Avoid excess consumption of the latter two since they can be inflammatory.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Take a B-vitamin supplement: </span>  The B-vitamins B-6, B-12, and folate are essential to lower the amount of homocysteine in your blood. High levels of homocysteine have been linked to arterial clogging and heart disease, making it critical to control.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Eat your greens: </span>  Chlorophyll is the plant nutrient that gives vegetables their green color. It is very similar to the hemoglobin molecule. Boosting your intake of greens combined with adequate iron helps boost your blood.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Spice things up: </span>  Cayenne helps speed blood purification by stimulating cardiovascular activity and lowering blood pressure. Add it to your meals for flavor and a stronger cardiovascular system.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Drink aloe vera juice: </span>  Aloe vera juice has been used for many years by herbalists as a natural blood booster. It cleanses arteries and is anti-inflammatory. It is also rich in amino acids, enzymes, chlorophyll, vitamins, and minerals—all of which help build strong blood.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Drink lots of water: </span>  Blood is largely made up of water and needs water to help it replenish.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Quit smoking: </span>  This seems fairly obvious since smoking pollutes blood but if you haven’t quit yet, there’s no time like the present.Discover the surprising toxins in common household products that gain direct access to your blood. </p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Switch to natural body care products: </span> Lotions, creams, and cosmetics are absorbed directly through the skin into the blood. If the products you use contain toxic ingredients you are giving them direct access to your blood.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Stop using air fresheners: </span> These products are full of harmful ingredients that gain access to your blood directly by being breathed and absorbed through the alveoli in your lungs and by landing on skin and being absorbed directly into your bloodstream. They are loaded with cancer-causing ingredients, male hormone disruptors, and mutagens that damage your genetic material. Check out my article: Exposed: Cancer-Causing Substances Found in Air Fresheners for more information.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Use dandelion root: </span> One of the best blood builders is also the most hated. Dandelion root has been shown to improve liver conditions by purifying the blood. Of course, you should not dig them up from lawns near busy roadsides or from those that have been sprayed. Dandelion root can be cooked and eaten in soups, stews.  It can be boiled in water, strained and drunk as a tea. It can also be roasted and made into a coffee-like drink.  Many health food stores carry dried dandelion root and dandelion coffee substitutes.  Follow package directions.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Eat more fruit and vegetables: </span> Fruit and vegetables are packed with nutrients and phytonutrients that build blood and reduce arterial plaque, making them essential allies in blood and cardiovascular health.
Discover the proven herb that attacks microbes in the blood
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">ake sarsaparilla root.</span> The root that flavors old-fashioned root beer has been shown to attack microbial substances in the bloodstream, thereby neutralizing them. It contains compounds called saponins that have natural antibiotic (bacteria-killing) properties. It can be taken as an herbal tincture (alcohol-based extraction), tea, or in capsule form. Follow package directions.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Eat more fiber: </span> Research shows that a diet high in soluble fiber are effective in eliminating plaque buildup in the arteries.
</p>
<p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;margin-left:10px;color:#330000;">
Eat a more alkaline diet: </span> The blood  pH is naturally 7.365 but our acid-forming diets can cause the balance to shift slightly in favor of acidity, which scours the arterial walls.  Reducing sugar, soda, meat, and processed foods in favor of alkaline vegetables (almost all vegetables are alkaline); alkaline fruits like avocados, fresh coconut, lemons, limes, and grapefruit; alkaline legumes like lentils, navy beans and soy; alkaline nuts and seeds like almonds, pumpkin seeds, sprouts, and sesame seeds; and alkaline grains like buckwheat, quinoa, and spelt.

Always check with your natural health practitioner or doctor prior to making any dietary or lifestyle changes and before starting supplements and herbs.
